# srilankatourismdata
A dataset which contains aggregated data related to tourism industry of sri lanka from 2020 to 2022

The data was taken from a Sri Lankan government website. For further information refer the following link http://www.statistics.gov.lk/abstract2023/chapter17#gsc.tab=0
<br>The data can be used for an exploratory analysis or basic analyses, as only aggregated information from 2020 to 2022 are available at the moment.
If there are any updates in the original site I will be updating this repo.

**Kindly note:**
The data is retrieved to an excel spreadsheet.
Seperate tables are maintained in seperate tabs. 
An aggregated table with all data are also available in 'Aggregated_Columns_Tourism' sheet.
